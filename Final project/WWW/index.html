                <h2>Brief explanation</h2>
                <p>Coronaviruses are a type of virus which have many different kinds and some cause diseases. COVID-19 was identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness that is called COVID-19. COVID-19 is different from SARS though they are both coronaviruses, SARS stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome and since the 2019 coronavirus is related to the original coronavirus that caused SARS and can also cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, there is “SARS” in its name: SARS-CoV-2. But SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and farther than the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 virus.
                    Like other viruses, there are different variants of COVID-19. Up to October 12, 2021, 15 designated variants have been under monitoring by the World Health Organization.

                <h2>Precautions</h2>
                <p>Firstly, it’s necessary to know about how COVID-19 spreads.
                    COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets and aerosols when an infected person talks, sings, coughs, shouts and sneezes.
                    Besides, COVID-19 can be also spread by touching something that has been exposed to infected or suspicious environments. So don’t forget to sanitize your hands before touching your face and eyes. And remember to disinfect the surfaces of your personal belongings when you get back to home from public places or whenever necessary.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Prevention for individuals</h2>

                    <li>Stay informed and keep following public health advice from local public health or medical authorities. Such as limiting gathering size for indoor and outdoor activities.</li>
                    <li>Only take essential trips out of your home or community. Isolate yourself away from others if you get a positive test result or have any symptoms of COVID-19 even if mild or when you are waiting a COVID-19 test result.</li>
                    <li>Make sure to reduce your unnecessary interactions with people outside of your household as less and as quickly as possible</li>
