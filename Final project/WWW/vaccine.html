                <h2>How mRNA vaccine work</h2>
                <p>
                    The mRNA vaccine is a new type of vaccine that has been introduced to the world during this Covid pandemic. A lot of people have doubts about its reliability because it came up so recently. This short paragraph will talk a little about how mRNA vaccines work and why it is relatively safe and reliable. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Message ribonucleic acid(mRNA) will provide instructions for our cells on how to create the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein which is a protein that exists on the surface of the virus. Then, our cell will recreate the protein piece and display it on the surface. After that, our immune system will soon realize that the protein piece does not belong to our body and start to create the antibodies that the body needs to fight the virus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to understand it in a more simple way, we can imagine Covid-19 as a criminal, mRNA vaccine as a witness and our immune system as the police. What mRNA does is it holds a drawing of a small part of the Covid-19, then hands it to our immune system, and from there, our immune system just knows how Covid-19 actually looks like.
